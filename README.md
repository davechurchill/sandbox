# sandbox

Code for the MUN AI and Games Lab Sandbox project

# Hardware

The hardware used for our sandbox is as follows, but is not required to be followed exactly:


- Intel RealSense Depth Camera D455

# Installation

This program uses sfml, the realsense sdk, and opencv, which must be installed separately.

For sfml you must create an environment variable called SFML_DIR pointing towards the sfml directory.

For opencv you must use opencv 4.8.0, and add the opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin directory to the environment path variable.

For the realsense sdk, simply downloading and installing it should suffice.
